INTRODUCTION                                                          *select*

Plugin works with recent (nightly) vim having |matchfuzzypos| function and
|prompt-buffer| feature implemented.

For buffers, MRU and commands it lets you narrow down the list with fuzzy
matching and select with <CR> or <Tab> if only 1 candidate is in the list.

For files it will let you go to parent directory with <BS> and to selected
directory with <CR>.

Project wide file search uses either `ripgrep` or `fd` tool so be sure you have
one of them installed on your system. By default it uses vim current working
directory as a project root.



MAPPINGS                                                     *select-mappings*

There are no default global mappings, add your own.

Safe (will not create mappings if plugin was not loaded):

>
    " add it to ~/.vim/after/plugin/select.vim
    if exists("g:loaded_select")
        nmap <leader>fo <Plug>(SelectFile)
        nmap <leader>ff <Plug>(SelectProjectFile)
        nmap <leader>fp <Plug>(SelectProject)
        nmap <leader>b <Plug>(SelectBuffer)
        nmap <leader>m <Plug>(SelectMRU)
        nmap <leader>; <Plug>(SelectCmd)
    endif

or regular:

    nmap <leader>fo <Plug>(SelectFile)
    nmap <leader>ff <Plug>(SelectProjectFile)
    nmap <leader>fp <Plug>(SelectProject)
    nmap <leader>b <Plug>(SelectBuffer)
    nmap <leader>m <Plug>(SelectMRU)
    nmap <leader>; <Plug>(SelectCmd)
