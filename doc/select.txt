INTRODUCTION                                                          *select*

Plugin works with recent (nightly) vim having |matchfuzzypos| function and
|prompt-buffer| feature implemented.

For buffers, MRU and commands it lets you narrow down the list with fuzzy
matching and select with <CR> or <Tab> if only 1 candidate is in the list.

For files it will let you go to parent directory with <BS> and to selected
directory with <CR>.

NOTE: No "project-wide" file selection like fzf or ctrlp have. Yet.


MAPPINGS                                                     *select-mappings*

There are no default global mappings, add your own.

Safe (will not create mappings if plugin was not loaded):

>
    " add it to ~/.vim/after/plugin/select.vim
    if exists("g:loaded_select")
        nmap <leader>f <Plug>(SelectFile)
        nmap <leader>b <Plug>(SelectBuffer)
        nmap <leader>m <Plug>(SelectMRU)
        nmap <leader>; <Plug>(SelectCmd)
    endif

or regular:
>
    " add it to your vimrc
    nmap <leader>f <Plug>(SelectFile)
    nmap <leader>b <Plug>(SelectBuffer)
    nmap <leader>m <Plug>(SelectMRU)
    nmap <leader>; <Plug>(SelectCmd)

<TAB> select next item in the list, for a single item it will open/execute it.

<BS> open parent directory. Only for |SelectFile|.              *select-<BS>*

<C-n> or <Down> select next item.                               *select-<C-n>*

<C-p> or <Up> select previous item.                             *select-<C-p>*
