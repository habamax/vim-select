= [WIP] vim-select: fuzzy select file/buffer/MRU/etc

Plugin works with recent (nightly) vim having `matchfuzzypos()` function and
`prompt-buffer` feature implemented.

For buffers, MRU and commands it lets you narrow down the list with fuzzy
matching and select with `<CR>` or `<Tab>` if only 1 candidate is in the list.

For files it will let you go to parent directory with `<BS>` and to selected
directory with `<CR>`.


NOTE: No "project-wide" file selection like fzf or ctrlp have. Yet.

== Installation

If you use package/plugin manager, consult their documentation.

For manual installation clone this repository to your
`~/.vim/pack/plugins/start/` path, where `plugins` subdirectory is arbitrary.

NOTE: for windows users replace `~/.vim` to `~/vimfiles`.


== Mappings

There are no default global mappings, add your own

.Safe (will not create mappings if plugin was not loaded)
[source,vim]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
" add it to ~/.vim/after/plugin/select.vim
if exists("g:loaded_select")
    nmap <leader>f <Plug>(SelectFile)
    nmap <leader>b <Plug>(SelectBuffer)
    nmap <leader>m <Plug>(SelectMRU)
    nmap <leader>; <Plug>(SelectCmd)
endif
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

or 

.Regular
[source,vim]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
" add it to your vimrc
nmap <leader>f <Plug>(SelectFile)
nmap <leader>b <Plug>(SelectBuffer)
nmap <leader>m <Plug>(SelectMRU)
nmap <leader>; <Plug>(SelectCmd)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Select window has default mappings:

* `<CR>` to open/execute current item.
* `<ESC>` to close the select window.
* `<TAB>` select next item in the list, for a single item it will open/execute
  it.
* `<BS>` open parent directory. Only for `SelectFile`.
* `<C-n>` or `<Down>` select next item.
* `<C-p>` or `<Up>` select previous item.
* `<PageUp>` scroll up select window.
* `<PageDown>` scroll down select window.

NOTE: no mappings to open in splits or tabs as of yet. Also no way to remap it too.


== Commands

* `:Select` without arguments opens select window for current file directory.
* `:SelectFile` to navigate filesystem and select/open files and directories.
  By default opens directory of a current file. Accepts directory as an
  argument.
* `:Select buffer` to select and open a buffer.
* `:Select mru` to select and open a file from history (most recently used).
* `:Select command` to select and execute an `:ex` command without parameters.
* `:Select colors` to select and apply a colorscheme.
