= vim-select: fuzzy select file/buffer/MRU/etc

Plugin works with recent (nightly) vim having `matchfuzzypos()` function and
`prompt-buffer` feature implemented.

For buffers, MRU and commands it lets you narrow down the list with fuzzy
matching and select with `<CR>` or `<Tab>` if only 1 candidate is in the list.

For files it will let you go to parent directory with `<BS>` and to selected
directory with `<CR>`.

Project wide file search uses either `ripgrep` or `fd` tool so be sure you have
one of them installed on your system. By default it uses vim current working
directory as a project root.
